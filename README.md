## Pandas DataFrame for Tidal Readings

This repo shows some of my first work with Data!

Using the Python Pandas library, I was able to maniuplate and convert data from a CSV text file into a DataFrame. There are various functions in here displaying the ability to extract specific data using Pandas.

See for yourself!
